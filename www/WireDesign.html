  Design Specifications for automotive wiring
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Maximum voltage drop shall be calculated at 12.5% for circuits.</li>
  <li>Source maximum voltage shall be calculated as 14.0v.</li>
  <li>Source minumum voltage shall be calculated as 9.0v.</li>
  <li>SAE J1128 is required for all engine bay wire.  Probably SXL or XLPE insulation from -40c to 125c.</li>
</ul>




<p>Just a basic idea of CFM to horsepower and or torque?  If this is solvable it would provide a basic start for induction and exhaust sizing.  Can an engine be broken down as a pump by displacement over one minute of revolution?  I.E. 7.1l of air X 6000 = amount of air to move?</p>
